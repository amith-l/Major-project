# Major-Project
#Flipkart-sentiment-analysis
In this project we scratched flipkart website, and extracted products list, their images and reviews.
By using vendor sentiment analysis, we analysed the sentiment of the consumers based on their product reviews.
Then the code is made for better visualization by creating streamlit webapp.
Finally the app is deposited in heroku and the final deployed link is here:
